# EzuraArc — Parking Page

A simple coming-soon / parking page for EzuraArc Private Limited.

## What's here

- `index.html` — the static landing/parking page.
- `assets/FinalLogo.svg` — company logo used by the page.

## Colors

- Primary: #FF6A3D
- Accent: #D74018
- Neutral: #62636E
- Deep: #0A00A0

## Preview locally

1. Open the file directly in a browser: open `index.html` with your browser of choice.

2. Or run a simple local server (recommended) from the project folder:

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# then open http://localhost:8000
```

## Notes

- The subscription form is a simple client-side handler that only shows a confirmation message — no backend integration is included.
- To change the logo, replace `assets/FinalLogo.svg` with a different image using the same filename.
